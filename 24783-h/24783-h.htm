<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">This</span> book you hold in your
hand belonged once to a very
celebrated Pirate.</div>

<p>He was so celebrated that the
newspapers&mdash;of that time&mdash;always
said nice things about him, and
always knew what he was doing
before he did himself. As he was
a very truthful man, he did the
things, so that the editors might
not get into trouble.</p>

<p>Which was kind.</p>

<p>By which I do not mean that
he was always kind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody knew how old he was.
Some said that he was so old that
he had never been born.</p>

<p>Some said that he must be young
or he could not be so wicked.</p>

<p>So you see there were two
opinions about him.</p>

<p>There are always two opinions
about a celebrated man.</p>

<p>If you look at him you will see
that he dressed to please himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>He wore a nice hat&mdash;but you
have noticed that; and he had a

that he looked around him a good

enemies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Tomb&mdash;that was not his

<p>One day Tomb captured a young fellow&mdash;a very handsome lad too.</p>

<p>It was off a certain island where
Tom Tomb had a neat cottage,
in the garden of which he grew
flowers for a pastime.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The young fellow was stealing
flowers.</p>

<p>He was surprised to see Captain Tomb.</p>

<p>When I say he was surprised,
you will see what I mean by the
picture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"What cinderadustmat do you mean," yelled Tomb, in a voice
like a railway accident, "by stealing my flowers?"</p>

<p>"I thought they were wild,"
said the young fellow, taking his
pipe from his mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wild!" shrieked Tomb.
"Wild!!" he bawled.</p>

<p>This last yell was so powerful
that three of his buttons flew off
his coat.</p>

<p>The young fellow caught them
neatly in his left hand, and presented
them to the Captain on
bended knee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought it must be your
face," said the lad boldly.</p>

<p>He was about to speak again,
had not Tomb silenced him with
a gesture. He liked the lad.</p>

<p>Had he spoken again,
Tomb would have silenced
him for ever.</p>

<p>He was about to say that
any other man with a face
like that would have died
long ago, from wounded
vanity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The lad hesitated. "My father .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."
he began.</p>

<p>"Dead," said Tomb, in a hollow
voice.</p>

<p>"My mother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Dead," Tomb replied, in a
monotonous whisper.</p>

<p>"My brother and sister .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>Tomb raised a sorrowful hand:
his heart was touched.</p>

<p>"My family .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." said the
young man in despair.</p>

<p>"My poor boy," said Tomb,
with tears in his eyes, "my poor,
dear fellow, I killed them all not
an hour ago."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then my sweetheart would
object to my becoming a Pirate,"
said the lad, weeping.</p>

<p>"Enough," said Tomb; "you are called from henceforth Dingy David. Now to sea!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>For ten years they plundered upon the Spanish Main, until they
acquired so much money that Bilge
Island, Tomb's business address,
smelt of hoarded gold, and the
beach glittered with jewels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Then both Tomb and David&mdash;I am
keeping the secret of his real name
to the end&mdash;became tired of so much
adventure.</p>

<p>They had sailed in many seas: the
Spanish Main&mdash;commonly known as
the Dining-room Carpetwaters&mdash;the
Kitchen Archipelago, the Drawing-room
Inland Sea, the Creek of Conservatory,
and the Lake of Passages.
They had roamed the Wilderness of
the High Street, the terrors of the
Gardens they knew, and the Gulf of
Front Hall was common water.</p>

<p>So they retired for a breathing space
and a wash to that Island where the
neat cottage stood and the geraniums
grew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>They moored the <i>Inky Murk</i>
to a low-growing pom-pom tree,
and then, stepping carefully, like
those unaccustomed to dry land
(or wet land either, for the matter
of that), they gazed upon each
other in silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

Tomb and Dingy David.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>A smell of breakfast smote his
nostrils pleasantly.</p>

<p>It was the work of a moment
to dash into the house, wash,
shave, and&mdash;there, upon a snowy
bed, were laid the very clothes
in which&mdash;long years ago&mdash;he
had been captured.</p>

<p>In another moment he was in
them and dashing downstairs, doing
up the buttons as he went.</p>

<p>He flung himself, panting, into

<p>"Listen," said Tomb, when he
regained his breath; and they,
gazing into each other's eyes,
listened.</p>

<p>"Gaze elsewhere," said Tomb,
"and I will unfold a tale."</p>

<p>In the heat of the moment
he put his sleeve into the butter.</p>

<p>Ermyntrude sprang to his assistance.
Tomb enfolded her in his embrace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"This lady is my daughter," he said, turning
to Wencheslaus, who stood amazed.</p>

<p>"I will not bother you with the story," said
Tomb, "but five and forty years ago I wooed and
wed her lovely mother. Twenty-one years ago
to-day Ermyntrude was born, and her mother,
after lingering two years, died. Leaving the girl
in the care of an honest fishwife (when I say honest,
I mean, as honest as her profession allowed),
I roamed the seas as a Pirate: sorrow made me
merciless. Then, when I wished to return to my
daughter, I found that I had lost her address."</p>

<p>"Father!" said Ermyntrude.</p>

<p>"My daughter," he exclaimed, "I am a
careless man!"</p>

<p>"And I?" said Wencheslaus&mdash;"what is the
secret of my birth?"</p>

<p>Going up to him, Tomb, with one superb
movement, bared the youth's arm. Upon it
was tattooed, in gold and purple, the crest of
a noble family.</p>

<p>"As I thought!" exclaimed Tomb; then
he removed his hat. "Lord Wencheslaus of
When-cheeselawn!"</p>

<p>"Then my father <i>was</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." the youth began.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Thingamaroo," said Tomb,
bowing low.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>A cry sounded from the cellars of the
cottage.</p>

<p>Tomb again started.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," said he. Then he
put his hand into his pocket, and drew
forth this very book.</p>

<p>"Ten years ago," said he, consulting
his notes, "I told you that I had killed
your family. It was not true."</p>

<p>"Not true?" said Lord Wencheslaus&mdash;for
so we must now call him.</p>

<p>"Not strictly accurate," Tomb replied.
"I immured them in these cellars,
with ten years' provisions."</p>

<p>With a noble gesture, he flung the key of the cellars upon the table.</p>

<p>"Release them, my Lord," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>When the boat was loaded with
the noble family, Lord Wencheslaus
(erstwhile Dingy David) and
Ermyntrude Tomb stood hand in
hand in front of Captain Thomas
Tomb.</p>

<p>"You must often come and see us, father," she said.</p>

<p>"My little Ermyntrude," he said,
"you can bet your back hair your
poor old father will often come."</p>

<p>Lord W. wrung Tomb's hand:
his emotion was too great for words.</p>

<p>They stepped into the boat and
sailed away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
